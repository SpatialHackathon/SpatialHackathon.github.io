[SpaceHack is now an official a BioHackathon Germany event](https://www.denbi.de/de-nbi-events/1678-biohackathon-germany-3)!

### Abstract

Spatially resolved transcriptomics allows us to resolve gene expression in the native tissue context. Imaging-based spatial transcriptomics methods offer an unrivaled spatial resolution, however clear and agreed-upon data processing and analysis guides are lacking or fragmented. SpaceHack 3.0 aims to investigate and improve on the currently available information to help users make sense of their valuable data. We will focus on **imaging-based spatial transcriptomics** methods such as MERFISH, ISS, osmFiSH, STARmap, etc (**not** Visium, GeoMX, slide-seq, stereoseq, ...).

### Project focus

The focus of our BioHackathon project will be on investigating, reporting, and improving user guides for imaging-based spatial transcriptomics. The format will be a hackathon with a "bring your own project" setup. Not everyone needs to propose a project, but here are some ideas of things to address:

 - writing user guides for data deposition
 - collating and unifying steps within data analysis user guides
 - investigating how people deal with normalisation
 - review segmentation-free analysis workflows

While the primary aim of the project will be to have fun and meet other spatial researchers, we will endeavour to disseminate our findings. This year we plan to wrap up our progress into a [BioHackRxiv](https://osf.io/preprints/biohackrxiv) white paper.

### Organisational details

**Target audience:** PhD/postdoc-level bioinformaticians familiar with spatial omics analysis. We would strongly encourage those with prior experience in spatial data analysis to apply! **This will not be a tutorial, so be ready to contribute ;p.**

**Dates:** Monday 9th - Wednesday 11th December 2024. The event precedes the [European Society for Spatial Biology's inaugural conference](https://spatialbiologysociety.eu/) on 12-13 Dec. 

**Location:** [Rahel Hirsch Center, 65 Luissenstrasse, 10117 Berlin, Germany](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Luisenstra%C3%9Fe+65,+10115+Berlin/@52.526864,13.376844,16z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x47a851ead44e366b:0xa6f8722630c14a29!8m2!3d52.526864!4d13.3794189!16s%2Fg%2F11c26_hb91?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MDkwOS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D). The venue for the SpaceHack is located in the Rahel Hirsch Center (Berlin Institute of Health) right next to the main Charite Hospital building.

**Transport:** GoogleMaps offers very reasonable suggestions in Berlin. Some suggestions: 
 - Airport: BER Berlin Brandenburg Aiport. There are trains (FEX/RE8/RB23/...) going to Berlin Hauptbahnhof (Berlin Central Station) every 20 minutes. Tickets can be downloaded via the [BVG app](https://www.bvg.de/de/abos-und-tickets/alle-apps/fahrinfo-app) and cost ~3-4 Euro for a Berlin ABC ticket.
 - Train station: Berlin Hauptbahnhof (Berlin Central Station) and walk for 12 minutes, or take the tram M5/M8/M10 to "Invalidenpark"

**Contact:** for more information email Naveed Ishaque, [naveed.ishaque@bih-charite.de](mailto:naveed.ishaque@bih-charite.de)

**Registration:** registration is free using [this webform](https://forms.gle/9sR4oj9eriu9A3nc7) before the deadline of 17.11.24. **The number of on-site participants is limited to 24 persons.** 

**Costs:** registration for the hackathon is free, however, you will have to pay your own travel, food and accommodation expenses. We will cover lunch and drinks during the event.

**Accommodation:** please check the usual hotel booking portals. [AO Hostels](https://www.aohostels.com/de/berlin/berlin-hauptbahnhof/) is a cheap option closeby, but there are many options in the vicinity.

**Organizing committee**: 
1.	**Main event, Berlin and online**: [Naveed Ishaque](mailto:naveed.ishaque@bih-charite.de), Berlin Institute of Health at the Charité, Germany. Naveed leads a bioinformatics research group with a strong focus on developing and applying computation methods to better understand spatially resolved transcriptomics data.
2.	**Memphis**: [Jasmine Plummer](mailto:jasmine.plummer@stjude.org). [Website](https://www.stjude.org/research/labs/plummer-lab.html). Address: [MS 322, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, 262 Danny Thomas Place, Memphis, TN, 38105-3678 USA](https://www.google.com/maps/place/262+Danny+Thomas+Pl,+Memphis,+TN+38105,+USA/@35.1529335,-90.0457645,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x87d57fa69ea48bd1:0x5fb5b3586b2af13a!8m2!3d35.1529335!4d-90.0431896!16s%2Fg%2F11ldvhnn3g?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTAwMi4xIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D)

**Commercial sponsors**: We are proud to say that 10x, NanoString/Bruker and Vizgen are all contributing data, personnel and financial support to SpaceHack 3.0!

### Code of Conduct
We want the hackathon to be fun, safe and inclusive. Participants are expected to adhere to the [de.NBI Code Of Conduct](https://www.denbi.de/code-of-conduct) and the [BIH DEI statement](https://www.bihealth.org/en/about-us/gutes-miteinander/mission-statement).

We will continue to update this website until the start of the hackathon
